# Yelp-Camp :camping:
* RESTful Web App based on User Reviews and Recommendations for Campsites - Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
* This app was previously developed on [Codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com), but I had to migrate to my local machine
at some point. :smile:

## Features:
* OAuth using [passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/)
